New episode: 


 you in how he is in the movie.
 ROSS:
 Not, not, not to herself, and then he got a little while.
 Chandler:
 Where's the phone?
 The phone?
 Rachel:
 I don't know where the phone is.
 (Ross runs from the table, over the couch but slips and falls onto the floor) Rachel:
 Ross?
 Ross:
 I'm hurt.
 Closing Credits [Scene:
 The Hallway, Ross is eagerly waiting for the others to get ready, to go to the hospital.] Ross:
 Monica, let's go.
 [Scene:
 Monica and Rachel's, the gang is waiting for Phoebe and Monica enter.] JOEY:
 Hey, hey, does he look at me where I was little, I mean, what about you?
 Chandler:
 Well, you know what I mean.
 PHOE:
 No, whad'ya mean?
 He's not British.
 JOEY:
 Maybe he's.
 .
 .
 gay.
 PHOE:
 Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem.
 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the baby was kinda surprised he was nice, and then he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
 Rachel:
 Wow.
 Chandler:
 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
 Ross:
 So Joey, you okay?
 Joey:
 Yeah, I guess.
 It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
 Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
 Rachel:
 Just think, my dad left, and I was wondering what they were.
 Phoebe:
 What are you doing?
 Monica:
 (Hushes her) Alright, great.
 Thanks a lot.
 (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.
 Rachel:
 What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
 Monica:
 This woman's got my life, I am so sorry...
 (They hug and Joey enters.) Joey:
 (watches them for a while) Oh my.
 [Scene:
 Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are sitting at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal] JOEY:
 Man this is weird.
 You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
 CHANDLER:
 That's what's weird?
 Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
 [Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.] CHANDLER:
 Waaa-aaah.
 JOEY:
 What?
 CHANDLER:
 The spoon.
 You licked and-and you put.
 You licked and you put.
 JOEY:
 Yeah, so.
 CHANDLER:
 Well don't you see how gross that is?
 I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.
 [Joey gets a sheepish look] You look good.
 Ross:
 I just got to talk to my unborn child.
 (Ross grabs for the package, and it breaks open.
 Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!
 I think he's drowning.
 (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows!
 Grab on a Sugar-O...
 save yourself!
 (Mimicking the bears) "Help!
 I'm drowning!
 Help!" Monica:
 (furious) That's it!
 Dinner is over!
 Steve:
 What?
 Monica:
 What?
 Rachel:
 Marcel?
 Monica:
 Marcel?
 Chandler:

 Joey:

 Chandler:

 (They come to a door and silently agree to try it.
 A very sweaty woman emerges) Woman No.
 1:
 Hi, can I help you?
 (Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment) Chandler:
 Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
 Joey:
 A monkey.
 Chandler:
 Yes some of us are married, uh...
 or who else knows?
 ROSS:
 No, I know I am.
 It's like two blocks as much as that you're not going to be in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
 Mindy:
 Yeah...
 I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna be really this big attitude problem.
 OPENING TITLES [Scene:
 Central Perk.
 Chandler, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are at the couch.] [Joey enters holding a letter] JOEY:

 Remore, know that I know it's a problem.

 So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
 Rachel:
 Oh, I don't know, like I was going out with her?
 Joey:
 (Thinking carefully) no.
 No, I understand.
 Yeah.
 Oh, oh, come on the elevator?
 Dr.
 Horton, Dr.

 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
 MONICA:
 Did they just kill off Joey?
 ROSS:
 No.
 [sound of Dr.
 Remore's body hitting the bottom of the shaft] Now maybe.
 [Scene:
 Joey's apartment.
 Everyone is outside knocking.] ROSS:
 C'mon.
 RACHEL:
 Joey.
 ROSS:
 Open up.
 We want to talk to you.
 JOEY:
 I don't know what to do, it's nice to see my head.
 [Scene:
 Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.] Chandler:
 (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle!
 I wasn't expecting the machine...
 Give me a call when you get a chance.
 (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye.
 (Hangs up.) Oh God!
 Monica:
 That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
 Chandler:
 Hey, I've been honing!
 Ross:
 What was with the dishes?
 Chandler:
 Oh, uh..
 I want to hear you say you want me to uh, clench anything, or-...
 Susie?
 Susie.
 SUSIE:
 This is for the fourth grade.
 CHANDLER:
 Huh?
 Where, whaddya mean?
 SUSIE:
 Whaddo I mean.
 Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean?
 I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
 CHANDLER:
 What, what's what you mean?
 SUSIE:
 My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing.
 I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
 CHANDLER:
 That was in the fourth grade.
 How could you still be upset about that?
 SUSIE:
 Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
 [she leaves with his clothes] CHANDLER:
 Alright, I hope you realize you're not gonna be able to enjoy this.
 ROSS:
 Yeah, I know, it's my birthday.
 We are not to hurt me your purse.

 ROSS:

 Hey, hey.

 Like at the end of a dance, HEY!

 [she starts nibbling his hand]

 Hey.

 He-hey.

 [Scene:

 Library.

 Phoebe is singing.]

 PHOEBE:

 [singing]

 There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you.

 .

 .

 But don't.

 Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do it.

 Phoebe:

 So you have to ask...

 [Scene:

 Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]

 Chandler:

 I am not really gonna be showing up here, but I think we're starting for you to find out!

 Rachel:

 Oh, please, you should feel like a cheap hooker who got there?

 Ross:

 Yeah, well, are you going?

 Ross:

 (leaving)

 I just don't want to know.

 (Carol and Susan laugh)

 [Scene:

 Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler use their knees as a table to support the lasagna.]

 Chandler:

 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I don't want to do something.

 Phoebe:

 Yeah, you wish!

 Chandler:

 It's just that I was writing.

 RACH:

 And I'm in this apartment, and now it's gone.

 ROSS:

 No, no, no.

 For me, gum is perfection.

 I loathe myself.

 [Scene:

 The hallway of Monica's building.

 Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the cat's owner.]

 Phoebe:

 (stops at a door)

 Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?

 Rachel:

 Oh.

 (they knock at the next door, Mr.

 Heckles answers)

 Hi.

 We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.

 Mr.

 Heckles:

 Er, yeah, it's mine.

 Phoebe:

 (trying to hold back the struggling cat)

 He seems to hate you.

 Are you sure?

 Mr.

 Heckles:

 Yeah, it's my cat.

 Give me my cat.

 Phoebe:

 Wait a minute.

 What's his name?

 Mr.

 Heckles:

 Ehhhh...

 B-Buttons.

 Rachel:

 Bob Buttons?

 Mr.

 Heckles:

 Mmm.

 Bob Buttons.

 Here, Bob Buttons.

 Phoebe:

 (the cat runs away from her)

 Oooh!

 You are a very bad man!

 Mr.

 Heckles:

 (as Phoebe and Rachel leave)

 You owe me a cat.

 RACH:

 Together?

 ROSS:

 Uh huh.

 RACH:

 Both of you?

 ROSS:

 Yep.

 RACH:

 Together.

 JULIE:

 Yeah, we figure it'll live with me in the bathroom.

 I don't know what to do.

 Ross:

 I got a lemon schmush.

 Monica:

 Come on, she'll be here any minute.

 (The whole party gathers round as Ross puts the box on the coffee table.)

 Rachel:

 I hope it's okay.

 (As Ross opens the lid, everybody looks at the mess inside.)

 Monica:

 Oh...

 Chandler:

 (Reading)

 "Happy Birthday Peehe." Monica:

 Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.

 (Phoebe quietly wanders in, to join the tableau.)

 Ross:

 (Still annoyed)

 Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.

 Phoebe:

 Hey, what's going on?

 Ross:

 Oh, we just...

 Phoebe's Friends:

 (Finally noticing the guest of honour)

 Surprise!

 Phoebe:

 (Delighted)

 oh, oh, oh!

 This is so great!

 Oh my god!

 This was not at all scary.

 Hi everybody.

 Hi Betty!

 Betty, Hi!

 (Thrilled)

 You found Betty!

 Oh my god!

 (Hugging people)

 This is great.

 Everybody I love is in the same way...

 Joey:

 Yeah, what're you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.

 ROSS:

 Hi.

 RACH:

 [sees his coat on]

 Where you goin'?

 I was going for quiet desperation.

 But if you have to ask...
